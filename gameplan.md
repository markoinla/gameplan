# Project Management Application Gameplan

## Overview
We're building a single-page project management application using Python and Flask for managing AI coding projects. The application will use server-side rendering with Jinja2 templates and expose a RESTful API.

## Tasks
- [x] Create gameplan.md
- [x] Project setup
  - [x] Create folder structure
  - [x] Create requirements.txt
  - [x] Create README.md with setup instructions
- [x] Database modeling
  - [x] Set up SQLAlchemy models for Project, Sprint, Task, and Issue
  - [x] Set up database migrations
- [x] Backend implementation
  - [x] Create Flask app structure
  - [x] Implement RESTful API endpoints for all models
  - [x] Implement data validation and error handling
- [x] Frontend implementation
  - [x] Create Jinja2 templates for UI
  - [x] Implement single-page layout with expand/collapse for sprints
  - [x] Add styling with CSS
  - [x] Add JavaScript for interactive UI
- [x] Application entry point
  - [x] Create app.py with initialization commands
  - [x] Add sample data generation
  - [x] Initialize database with sample data
- [x] Testing
  - [x] Create test files for API endpoints
  - [x] Run tests to verify functionality
- [x] Documentation
  - [x] Document API endpoints
  - [x] Update README.md with final instructions
- [x] Bug fixes
  - [x] Fix template error with undefined 'now' variable
  - [x] Update tests to include required fields in update requests

## Notes
- The application uses SQLite for data persistence
- We've used Flask-SQLAlchemy for database interaction
- We've implemented RESTful principles with appropriate HTTP methods and status codes
- The UI is a single page with a vertical layout
- Bootstrap is used for responsive design and modals
- JavaScript handles the client-side interactions with the API
- The application is now running at http://127.0.0.1:5001

## Next Actions
1. Access the application in your browser at http://127.0.0.1:5001
2. Try creating, editing, and deleting projects, sprints, tasks, and issues
3. All tests are now passing! You can verify this by running:
   ```
   source venv/bin/activate
   python -m pytest tests/
   ```
4. Optional future enhancements:
   - Add user authentication and authorization
   - Add data export functionality
   - Add search capabilities
