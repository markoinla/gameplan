# Project Management Application Gameplan

## Overview
We're building a single-page project management application using Python and Flask for managing AI coding projects. The application will use server-side rendering with Jinja2 templates and expose a RESTful API.

  - [x] Create folder structure
  - [x] Create requirements.txt
  - [x] Create README.md with setup instructions
- [x] Database modeling
  - [x] Set up SQLAlchemy models for Project, Sprint, Task, and Issue
  - [x] Set up database migrations
- [x] Backend implementation
  - [x] Create Flask app structure
  - [x] Implement RESTful API endpoints for all models
  - [x] Implement data validation and error handling
- [x] Frontend implementation
  - [x] Create Jinja2 templates for UI
  - [x] Implement single-page layout with expand/collapse for sprints
  - [x] Add styling with CSS
  - [x] Add JavaScript for interactive UI
- [x] Application entry point
  - [x] Create app.py with initialization commands
  - [x] Add sample data generation
  - [x] Initialize database with sample data
- [x] Testing
  - [x] Create test files for API endpoints
  - [x] Run tests to verify functionality
- [x] Documentation
  - [x] Document API endpoints
  - [x] Update README.md with final instructions
- [x] Bug fixes
  - [x] Fix template error with undefined 'now' variable
  - [x] Update tests to include required fields in update requests
- [x] Version Control
  - [x] Initialize Git repository
  - [x] Create .gitignore file
  - [x] Make initial commit
  - [x] Push to GitHub
- [x] MCP Implementation
  - [x] Add MCP dependencies to requirements.txt
  - [x] Create MCP server module
  - [x] Implement tool definitions for all CRUD operations
  - [x] Integrate MCP server with Flask application
  - [x] Document MCP implementation
  - [x] Fix MCP server integration issues
  - [x] Configure Windsurf to use the GamePlan MCP server
- [x] MCP Windsurf Integration
  - [x] Research the correct format for URL-based MCP configurations in Windsurf
  - [x] Create a standalone MCP server script for command-based configuration
  - [x] Update Windsurf MCP configuration to use command-based approach
  - [ ] Test MCP server with Windsurf after configuration fixes
  - [ ] Document the final working Windsurf MCP configuration approach

## Notes
- The application uses SQLite for data persistence
- We've used Flask-SQLAlchemy for database interaction
- We've implemented RESTful principles with appropriate HTTP methods and status codes
- The UI is a single page with a vertical layout
- Bootstrap is used for responsive design and modals
- JavaScript handles the client-side interactions with the API
- The application is now running at http://127.0.0.1:5001
- The codebase is now version-controlled with Git and hosted on GitHub
- MCP (Model Context Protocol) server is integrated, allowing AI assistants to interact with the application
- The MCP server is accessible at http://127.0.0.1:5001/mcp with tools available at http://127.0.0.1:5001/mcp/tools
- We've created a standalone MCP server script (mcp_server.py) that can be started by Windsurf using the command-based approach
- Windsurf is now configured to use the GamePlan MCP server via the command-based approach instead of the URL connection method

## Next Actions
1. Access the application in your browser at http://127.0.0.1:5001
2. Try creating, editing, and deleting projects, sprints, tasks, and issues
3. All tests are now passing! You can verify this by running:
   ```
   source venv/bin/activate
   python -m pytest tests/
   ```
4. Install the new dependencies for MCP:
   ```
   source venv/bin/activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
5. Run the application with MCP enabled:
   ```
   source venv/bin/activate
   flask run --port=5001
   ```
6. Use Windsurf with the GamePlan MCP server:
   - Restart Windsurf to load the updated MCP configuration
   - Ask AI assistants to interact with your GamePlan application
   - Try commands like "Create a new project called 'Website Redesign'" or "List all active sprints"
7. Test the new command-based MCP configuration:
   - Ensure the Flask server is running at http://127.0.0.1:5001
   - Restart Windsurf to load the updated MCP configuration
   - Try using the GamePlan MCP tools through Windsurf
8. Optional future enhancements:
   - Add user authentication and authorization
   - Add data export functionality
   - Add search capabilities
   - Add authentication to MCP for production use
